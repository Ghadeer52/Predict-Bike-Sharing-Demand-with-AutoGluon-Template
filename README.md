# Predict-Bike-Sharing-Demand-with-AutoGluon-Template

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict bike-sharing demand using AutoGluon, an automated machine learning toolkit developed by AWS. The goal is to create a model that can accurately forecast the number of bikes required at different times, based on various features such as weather conditions, time of day, and other relevant factors.
